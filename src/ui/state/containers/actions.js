// Actions are pure functions that generate action objects
// These action objects are effectively messages that are processed
// by our reducer

// When we create actions, we will always create a function and a constant
// that identifies that function, and export those

// So let's create an action to get our Containers
// (Note: Working with async calls in redux is a little trickier, so for now let's hardcode our result)

// Step 1: Create the action constant
const GET = ''

// Step 2: Create the action function
const get = () => null

// Step 3: Export
export {
  // values to export
}
